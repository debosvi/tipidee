tipidee - a minimalistic web server
-----------------------------------

 tipidee is a minimalistic HTTP/1.1 web server. It is designed to
run under a super-server like inetd or s6-tcpserver. It supports
most of the HTTP protocol.

 See https://skarnet.org/software/tipidee/ for details.

 tipidee is still in ALPHA state. There is no numbered version
release yet (the download link will not work), it's not fully
documented yet, and there is no guarantee it will work for you.
Please be patient.
