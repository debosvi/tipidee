<h1> The <tt>tipideed</tt> program </h1>

<p>
 <tt>tipideed</tt> is the binary that actually does what you want from
a web server package: it serves files over HTTP.
</p>

<h2> Interface </h2>

<pre>
     tipideed [ -v <em>verbosity</em> ] [ -f <em>cdbfile</em> ] [ -d <em>basedir</em> ] [ -R ] [ -U ]
</pre>

<ul>
 <li> tipideed reads a stream of HTTP (1.0 or 1.1) requests on its stdin, and tries
to fulfill them, sending answers to stdout, and logs to stderr. </li>
 <li> tipideed only speaks plaintext HTTP. It supports HTTPS, but the TLS layer
must be handled upstream by a program such as
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6-networking/s6-tlsd.html">s6-tlsd</a>. </li>
 <li> tipideed stays alive until the client closes the connection or (in
HTTP 1.1) sends a request with a <tt>Connection: close</tt> header, or an error
occurs that makes it nonsensical to keep the connection open. </li>
 <li> By default, the documents it serves must be in subdirectories of its
current working directory, one subdirectory for every domain it hosts. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Exit codes </h2>

<dl>
 <dt> 0 </dt> <dd> clean exit. The client closed the connection after a stream of
HTTP exchanges. </dd>
 <dt> 100 </dt> <dd> bad usage. tipideed has been run in an incorrect way: bad command
line options, or missing environment variables, etc. </dd>
 <dt> 101 </dt> <dd> cannot happen. This signals a bug in tipideed, and comes with an
error message asking you to report the bug. Please do so. </dd>
 <dt> 111 </dt> <dd> system call failed. If this happens while serving a request,
tipideed likely has sent a 500 (Internal Server Error) response to the
client before exiting. </dd>
</dl>

<h2> Detailed operation </h2>

<h2> Notes </h2>

<ul>
 <li> <tt>tipideed</tt> is pronounced <em>tipi-deed</em>. You can also say
<em>tipi-dee-dee</em>, but only if you're the type of person who says
<em>PC computer</em>, <em>NIC card</em> or <em>ATM machine</em>. </li>
